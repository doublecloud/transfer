    The system is built around a <strong>core module</strong> that acts as the central part of the application, 
    managing its internal logic and facilitating communication between components.
    Users can interact with the system through either a <strong>Command-Line Interface (CLI)</strong> or via a 
    <strong>Component Development Kit (CDK)</strong>, 
    which serves as a library of interfaces for embedding functionality into external systems.
