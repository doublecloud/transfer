    title: Frequently asked questions
    items:
      - title: What's the difference between serverless and dedicated mode?
        text: >-
          In serverless mode, you don't need to pay attention to how many worker
          nodes are working and you don't need to adjust that number manually.
          Transfer will automatically scale up and scale out the
          mode depending on the amount of data you have at your source.
          Dedicated mode is when you need extra security and isolation from
          other customers. Also, in that mode, you can establish VPC peering
          with other AWS accounts. You will have dedicated virtual machines
          under the hood for use only for you in that mode.
      - title: What type of synchronization/transfer do you support?
        text: |
          Transfer supports three modes of synchronization:
          - Full snapshot
          - Log-based replication or CDC (Change data capture)
          - Key-based replication
          - Snapshot + log-based replication
      - title: Do I need to pay for traffic?
        text: >-
          No, you do not need to pay for ingress, cross-az, cross-region, or
          egress traffic. However, you should check pricing for egress
          with your cloud provider. If you are using AWS, you could establish
          VPC peering, which will decrease your costs.
      - title: What is Change Data Capture? Does Transfer support it?
        text: >-
          In databases, Change Data Capture is a set of software design patterns
          used to determine and track data that has changed, so that actions can
          be taken using the changed data. 


          Transfer supports Change Data Capture, but only for
          sources that support that on their side, e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL,
          MongoDB, and others.
      - title: How does key-based replication work?
        text: >-
          Key-based replication is a method in which a column called a
          Replication Key is used to identify new and updated data.
      - title: What is snapshot replication?
        text: >-
          Snapshot replication distributes data exactly as it appears at a
          specific moment in time and does not monitor for updates to the data.
