// Store is general interface for all critical file system operations required to read and write
// the Delta logs. The correctness is predicated on the atomicity and durability guarantees
// of the implementation of this interface. Specifically,
// Consistent listing: Once a file has been written in a directory, all future listings for
// that directory must return that file.
// All subclasses of this interface is required to have a constructor that takes StoreConfig
// as a single parameter. This constructor is used to dynamically create the Store.
// Store and its implementations are not meant for direct access but for configuration based
// on storage system. See [[https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-storage.html]] for details.
