//
// When reading the wal, we have 2 types of watermarks needed to check in wal (low and high):
//   - low - means that we are now just before the moment, when we start reading from the database
//   - high - means that we have completed reading
//
// Also we have 2 types needed to resolve additional problem (success watermark and bad watermark):
//   - success - needed to save the last successfully transferred chunk
//   - bad - it is necessary to mark an invalid watermark type
